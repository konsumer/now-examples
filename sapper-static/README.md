# sapper-static

This is a demo-app using [sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) and [svelte](https://svelte.dev/) to generate a static app that can be deployed on [now](https://zeit.co/now).

## development

```
npm i          # install development tools
npm start      # run local development server
npm run deploy # deploy on zeit now
```

These are all included in `now` cli, so you can do same with these:

```
npm i -g now   # install development tools
now dev        # run local development server
now            # deploy on zeit now
```
